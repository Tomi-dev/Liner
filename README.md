# Liner

Liner is a small and lightweight JavaScript module to determine every line separetly in a given text container, 
so its easier to target every separate line with a different animation, or with any other stuff.

To init Liner all you have to do is to call the "init" function for example: <code>Liner.init('.headline', 'liner-line');</code>

The first argument represents the <code>text container in the DOM</code> and the second represents the <code>separate lines's class name</code>

The generated lines with the given class name will look like this <code>liner-line-0</code> <code>liner-line-1</code> et cetera.
